This rifampicin model is intended to be used as a perpetrator in CYP3A4-mediated drug-drug interactions. The model features verified CYP3A4 induction, transient competitive CYP3A4 inhibition. Additional features represent P-gp induction and inhibition.

## Repository files

Within this repository, we distribute a whole-body PBPK model of rifampicin, that has been developed using a large number of clinical studies and evaluated within the DDI modeling network. 

The PK-Sim project file contains simulations of all published clinical studies employed during model establishment, including the respective observed data digitized from literature reports. For further details, quantitative model evaluation, sensitivity analysis and extensive documentation please refer to Hanke et al. 2018 [[1](#reference)].
