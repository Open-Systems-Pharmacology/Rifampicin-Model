The rifampicin model was built and verified using various clinical studies. Overall, the model shows good performance to describe plasma concentration-time profiles over a dose range of 300 to 600 mg after intravenous and oral administration. 

The next sections show:

1. the final model input parameters for the building blocks: [Section 3.1](#31-Final-Input-Parameters).
2. the overall goodness of fit: [Section 3.2](#32-Diagnostics-Plots).
3. simulated vs. observed concentration-time profiles for the clinical studies used for model building and for model verification: [Section 3.3](#33-Concentration-Time-Profiles).
