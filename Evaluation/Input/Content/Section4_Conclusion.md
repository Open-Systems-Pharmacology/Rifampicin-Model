The herein presented PBPK model adequately describes the pharmacokinetics of rifampicin in adults. Little is known on the exact mass balance and the full metabolic profile of rifampicin. In this PBPK model, the implemented processes are those that were considered most vital to describe rifampicin's PK and that could be informed either via *in vitro* data or via parameter optimization based on clinical PK data.

The herein presented quantification of induction processes on OATP1B1 and AADAC are purely based on parameter optimization to describe auto-induction phenomena of rifampicin. The herein presented induction process of P-gp is based on *in vivo* observed P-gp induction measured in duodenal biopsies ([Greiner 1999](#5-References)). The derived E<sub>max</sub> value was assumed to be applicable for P-gp induction in all tissues expressing P-gp. This needs to be considered when coupling the herein presented rifampicin model to PBPK models of potential victim drugs that are also subjects to P-gp-mediated transport.

Endogenous protein half-lives of OATP1B1, AADAC, and P-gp are not known. Thus, values reported for CYP3A4 were assumed in this PBPK model. These values were needed to implement induction of the three proteins. However, sensitivity of these parameters on simulated rifampicin plasma concentration is very low.

The model features in particular induction of CYP3A4 based on aggregated *in vitro* CYP3A4 activity data in primary human hepatocytes ([Templeton 2011](#5-Reference)). The model also accounts for competitive inhibition of CYP3A4.
